you need to go to cmd and type py -m pip install -U discord.py
if that doesn't work then try python -m pip install -U discord.py

**you need python version 3.6.5/3.6.7 or it will not work** (for the cmd you need python 3.6.5 before you do it, and you can't have 3.7 or it won't work)

then you need to invite either https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=547859492864262165&permissions=2146958839&scope=bot
or https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=547891656331100162&permissions=2146958839&scope=bot
at the bottom you'll see bot.run
the one already in there is for the second linked bot, the one noted above it is for the first

if one is banned then add the other
the commands are displayed when you run the code in the shell window

the kick and ban commands might not work, but the spam and channel spam one's do.

you're not a complete idiot, so i assume you can look and see where the names are to change what it spams and the name of the channel for the channel spams

have fun and good luck soldier uwu uwu uwu uwu
