***note for r/fcord: the bot is currently not on any servers, otherwise i wouldn't've left the access token public. nice try though hackerboys***

**archie, daisy, and matthew note:**

you need to go to cmd and type py -m pip install -U discord.py
if that doesn't work then try python -m pip install -U discord.py

**you need python version 3.6.5/3.6.7 or it will not work** (for the cmd you need python 3.6.5 before you do it, and you can't have 3.7 or it won't work)


then you need to ask me for an invite code, as i'll need to make a new bot every time

at the bottom you'll see bot.run

pop the token i give you in there and it'll run fine. user tokens don't work, don't try it.


if one is banned then ask me to make another

the commands are displayed when you run the code in the shell window


the kick and ban commands might not work due to permissions, but the spam and channel spam ones do. they definitely do.

you're not a complete idiot, so i assume you can look and see where the names are to change what it spams and the name of the channel for the channel spams

have fun and good luck soldier uwu uwu uwu uwu
